## 📞 Meta CAPI

```
POST graph.facebook.com/v18.0/{pixel_id}/events
{
  event_name, event_time, action_source,
  user_data: { em (sha256), ph (sha256), fbc, fbp,
               client_ip_address, client_user_agent },
  custom_data: { currency, value, content_ids }
}
```

**Dedup keys:** `event_id` + `event_name` + `event_time` + `fbc/fbp`

**Typical recovery:** 15–30% in 6 weeks.

## 🔢 Differential Privacy

```
Lower ε  →  stronger privacy, more noise (less utility)
Higher ε →  weaker privacy, less noise (more utility)
```

Used in: SKAN, Attribution Reporting API, clean-room outputs.

## 📜 Regulatory Map (2026)

| Law | Where | Key issue |
|-----|-------|-----------|

## ⚖️ Sephora 2022 Lessons

1. Honor browser-level signals (GPC).

3. Server-side + first-party-cookie architecture is now table stakes.

## 🏆 Exam Power Phrases

✅ Often correct:

- "Hashed PII is still personal data under GDPR..."
- "Advanced Consent Mode + modeling for EU..."
- "Server-side CAPI recovers 15-30%..."
- "Design the 6-bit SKAN conversion value as LTV bins..."
- "Clean room: query, not raw data, leaves the silo..."

❌ Often wrong:

- "Hashing removes GDPR obligations..."
- "Server-side bypasses GDPR..."
- "SKAN gives you user-level data..."
- "GDPR only applies to EU companies..."

---

## ⚠️ Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Pixel-only with no CAPI in 2026
- ❌ Basic Consent Mode in the EU
- ❌ Ignoring GPC
- ❌ 6-bit SKAN value used as "install/not"
- ❌ Treating clean rooms as full data access
- ❌ Treating GDPR compliance as one-time
- ❌ Probabilistic ID for activation in regulated industries
